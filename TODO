Migraine False Positives
------------------------
- limit EndNote DB Migraine_ALL_Mark to "Name of database = Cochrane" and "Label > 0"
- find duplicates (with only field Label) 
- there are false positives, a.o. Label 6288, 6368, 6460, 6616, 6810, ... Are they all conference proceedings?

Depression
----------
- IF (but only then) there are other files where the PY has been put into the pages field: replace the pages field with null.
  If this is done, then a the truth file should be adapted?
  Check on BIG_SET and subset of other files: no cases found
- "Brain research" with its sections can be solved: regex like "Brain Res.*Brain Res.*"?

Cochrane reviews
----------------
What is preferred way?
- user should not lose new updates (see also living reviews)
- since it is is not possible to apply this rule only for the last versions, it applies always
 
Prefer DOI above starting page because different versions of a review have different DOIs.
==> there should be a boolean Cochrane attribute
Question: are there other journals with similar versions of articles?
Current practice of comparing starting page (Cd003229) above DOI (10.1002/14651858.cd003229.pub3) merges different versions of same or consecutive years

The BIG_SET database has no examples of Cochrane reviews from Medline_OVID!
The ASySD_SRSR_Human database has cases for database "Ovid Technologies":
- issue: CD005488, starting page: empty, DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD005488.pub2
- issue: empty, starting page: CD008237, DOI: empty   (is this EMBASE_OVID?)

Using DOI before starting page won't help in all cases:
- if Cochrane AND starting page empty AND issue LIKE 'CD.*' ==> use ISSUE to starting page (and keep all characters, don't limit to numbers)
- add PY to starting page ==> with absent DOIs no more merges over consecutive years

DOIs with unwanted additions
----------------------------
- eLife has DOI's for different sections: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06487.001 (in SRSR Human)
- PLoS ONE has DOIs for figures: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0094853.g001 (in SRSR Human)
