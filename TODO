XML parsing
===========
+ check if original DTD produces usable files with xjc (is this domain/xml?)
  if not: 
  + clean up files in domain/xml
  + document in wiki
- make DTD for Zotero
  + parse files
  - compare xml parses with RIS parses
  + write records and compare with original Zotero xml files
- input routine should be able to identify if the XML file is EndNote format or Zotero format
- (additional reason to split the original DTD into 2 DTDs: writing to the same XML format as the input file is easier)
- Zotero has no custom fields (?)

Structure of EndNote files
==========================
- https://community.endnote.com/t/trying-to-understand-my-en20-library-and-recreate-it-for-en-21/711538
- https://support.clarivate.com/Endnote/s/article/EndNote-Description-of-the-Data-folder-that-accompanies-enl-library-files?language=en_US
- https://omicx.cc/posts/2021-11-04-fix-corrupted-endnote-library/ says:
  The .enl and .eni are SQLite3 databases, and the validity of these files could be checked by SQLiteStudio. 
  In this situation, the “mylib.enl” file might be ok, but index database “.eni” corrupted.
  (SQLiteStudio: https://sqlitestudio.pl/) 
  
  Could an EndNote DB be opened with SQLite (https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-java/sqlite-jdbc-driver/)?
  
Upgrade to Spring Boot 3
------------------------
Used OpenRewrite
1. Problem webjars-locator: why is this removed by by OpenReWrite
WARNING Cannot find template location: classpath:/templates/ (please add some templates, check your Thymeleaf configuration, or set spring.thymeleaf.check-template-location=false)
- WebConfig::addResourceHandlers
with
  registry.addResourceHandler("/resources/**").addResourceLocations("/public", "classpath:/static/");
the application won't start (and there's a message that Thymeleaf cannot find its /templates directory

Migraine False Positives
------------------------
- limit EndNote DB Migraine_ALL_Mark to "Name of database = Cochrane" and "Label > 0"
- find duplicates (with only field Label) 
- there are false positives, a.o. Label 6288, 6368, 6460, 6616, 6810, ... Are they all conference proceedings?  

EndNote 20

Retractions
-----------
- Retracted publications: BIG_SET 7921 set and 42247
- Article: Shi, Qianling et al., More Consideration is Needed for Retracted Non-Cochrane Systematic Reviews in Medicine: A Systematic Review,
  in: Journal of Clinical Epidemiology, Volume 0, Issue 0

Depression
----------
- IF (but only then) there are other files where the PY has been put into the pages field: replace the pages field with null.
  If this is done, then a the truth file should be adapted?
  Check on BIG_SET and subset of other files: no cases found
- "Brain research" with its sections can be solved: regex like "Brain Res.*Brain Res.*"?

Cochrane reviews
----------------
What is preferred way?
- user should not lose new updates (see also living reviews)
- since it is is not possible to apply this rule only for the last versions, it applies always
 
Prefer DOI above starting page because different versions of a review have different DOIs.
==> there should be a boolean Cochrane attribute
Question: are there other journals with similar versions of articles?
Current practice of comparing starting page (Cd003229) above DOI (10.1002/14651858.cd003229.pub3) merges different versions of same or consecutive years

The BIG_SET database has no examples of Cochrane reviews from Medline_OVID!
The ASySD_SRSR_Human database has cases for database "Ovid Technologies":
- issue: CD005488, starting page: empty, DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD005488.pub2
- issue: empty, starting page: CD008237, DOI: empty   (is this EMBASE_OVID?)

Using DOI before starting page won't help in all cases:
- if Cochrane AND starting page empty AND issue LIKE 'CD.*' ==> use ISSUE to starting page (and keep all characters, don't limit to numbers)
- add PY to starting page ==> with absent DOIs no more merges over consecutive years

DOIs with unwanted additions
----------------------------
- eLife has DOI's for different sections: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06487.001 (in SRSR Human)
- PLoS ONE has DOIs for figures: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0094853.g001 (in SRSR Human)
