                        <h3 id="publication_year">1. Publication year: Are they at most 1 year apart?</h3>
                        <p>This 1 year margin was chosen because "ahead of print" publications and final publications
                            often are not published in the same year. A margin larger than 1 year would make the program
                            a lot slower (see <a href="#order_of_comparisons">Justification: Order of comparisons</a>).
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Preprocessing: Publications years before 1800 are removed.</li>
                            <li>Insufficient data: Records without a publication year are compared to all records unless
                                they already have been identified as a duplicate.</li>
                            <li>Special cases: Cochrane Reviews are compared for the same publication year only.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 id="starting_page_or_doi">2. Starting page or DOI: Are they the same?</h3>
                        <p> If the Starting and Ending page of at least one of the publications are more than 2 pages
                            apart,<br />
                            then: the DOIs are compared first. If the DOIs are different or one or both are absent, then
                            the starting pages are compared,<br />
                            otherwise: the starting pages are compared first. If the starting pages are different or one
                            or both are absent, the DOIs are compared.</p>
                        <p>Meeting abstracts often get the DOI of the whole conference proceedings. Comparing them by
                            DOI produces a lot of False Positives. Using this "more than 2 pages" choice circumvents
                            this problem.

                                <li>If bibliographic databases didn't miss some data: DOI

                                    has Pages information in PubMed, but not in EMBASE or Scopus</li>
                                <li>If EndNote import filters (EndNote provided, provided by producers of bibliographic
                                    databases, home made) always put comparable data in the same EndNote fields</li>

                            <p>DedupEndNote therefore interprets a comparison with insufficient data from one of two

                                (yet)), and continues with the other comparisons for these records.</p>
                            <p>As a consequence, fields which are useful in comparisons but are not always available
                                (e.g.

                            <p>NOTE: If <strong>both</strong> records have insufficient data for a comparison,
                                DedupEndNote interprets the fields as different. If there is no alternative for the
                                comparison (see below), then DedupEndNote stops the comparisons for this pair of records
                                and considers them different publications. See <a href="#effect">2.5. Effect of

                                    <li>JWS is always a value between 0 and 1 making it easier to choose a cut-off point
                                        for
                                        allowed similarity (e.g. similarity &gt; 0.91)</li>
                                    <li>JWS's property of putting a heavier penalty on differences at the beginning of
                                        strings proved very helpful in comparing Titles and Authors:

                                            <li>"..." and "... - Commentary" are more similar than if a less partial
                                                similarity measure was used</li>
                                            <li>"..." and "Case report: ..." (when compared in their reversed form) are
                                                more similar than if a less partial similarity measure was used</li>
                                            <li>some bibliographic databases list all authors, others limit them and add
                                                "et al."

                                    <li>JWS proved useful, so no other similarity measures were tested</li>

                                    looks at first sight to only compare journal articles (with the additional effect
                                    that no publications of another type can ever be a duplicate). This is not
                                    completely true:</p>

                                    records have insufficient data for that comparison. Two book records with the same
                                    authors, publication year and book title will be considered duplicates only if both
                                    have the same / a similar ISBN.

                                <p>Relaxing this general rule (so that comparisons with insufficient data in one or both
                                    records are treated the same way: UNKNOWN, so go on to the next comparison) would

                        <p>If you want to manually merge the records which are duplicates according to DedupEndNote, you
                            can use Mark mode.</p>
                        <p>Because Zotero does not work with / does not show record numbers, Mark Mode is not relevant
                            for Zotero users.</p>

                        <p>In Mark mode the ID of the first record of a set of duplicate records is copied to the label
                            field ("LB") of all duplicate records. The input file is copied to the output file with the
                            addition of the Label field if it is not empty. The original content of the Label field is
                            overwritten! All other fields are copied as is (so no enriching of the output: prescribed
                            form of DOI, ...).</p>

                        <p>After importing the results file into a new EndNote database, make the Label field visible.
                            The IDs in the Label field refer to the IDs of the <u>original</u> EndNote database.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To see the duplicates, search for "Label" "is greater than" 0, and sort on the label

                            </li>
                            <li>To manually merge, change in Preferences / Deduplicate the fields to deduplicate on to

                            <li>The records marked as Unread were identified as duplicates by DedupEndNote, but not by
                                EndNote itself.</li>

                            quite different. DedupEndNote changes the data of these records to a common format when it
                            imports them so that deduplication can work. The deduplicated output is also standardized:

                    <div id="limitations">
                        <h2 class="bg-success-subtle">Limitations</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Input file size: The maximum size of the input file is limited to 150MB.</li>
                            <li>Input file format: The program only handles files in RIS format, not in XML or CSV
                                format.</li>
                            <li>Input file encoding: The program assumes that the input file is encoded as UTF-8.</li>
                            <li>If authors AND (all) titles AND (all) journal names for a record use a non-Latin script,
                                results for this record may be inaccurate.</li>
                            <li>(when deduplicating one file:) The input file must be an export from ONE EndNote
                                database: the ID fields are used internally for identifying the records, so they have to
                                be unique. However, if the RIS file does not have an ID field in the first publication,
                                DedupEndNote assumes the whole file has no ID fields and gives every publication an ID
                                (starting with 1). This has only been tested on Zotero files!</li>
                            <li>The program has been developed and tested for biomedical databases (PubMed, EMBASE, ...)
                                and some general databases (Web of Science, Scopus). The data sets used were the results
                                of biomedical queries. Deduplicating records from other databases is not guaranteed to
                                work, and performance is often very poor, esp. for non journal articles
                                (see <a href="#effect">Justification. 2.5. Effect of
                                    insufficient data from one of two records</a>).</li>
                            <li>The program uses a bibliographic point of view:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>an article or conference abstract that has been published in more than one
                                        (issue of a) journal is not considered a duplicate publication.</li>
                                    <li>Records for each publication year are compared to records from the same and the
                                        following year: a record from 2016 is compared to the records from 2015 (when
                                        treating the records from 2015) and from 2016 and 2017 (when treating the
                                        records from 2016). A PubMed ahead-of-print record from 2013 and a corresponding
                                        record from 2017 (when it was 'officially' published) will not be compared (and
                                        possibly deduplicated).</li>
                                    <li>Bibliographic databases are not always very accurate in the starting page of a
                                        publication. Because starting page is part of the comparisons, DedupEndNote
                                        misses the duplicates when bibliographic databases don't agree on the starting
                                        page (and one or both records have no DOIs).</li>
                                </ul>

                        <h3 id="endnote">1. Why only EndNote / Zotero RIS export files?</h3>
                        <div>EndNote (and Zotero?) is very good at importing export files from many bibliographic
                            databases. The
                            RIS export from an EndNote / Zotero database has a standard format,
                            which makes reading and interpreting records for DedupEndNote a lot easier.</div>
                        <div>(This version of) DedupEndNote does not read EndNote XML exports, because reading and
                            writing XML
                            files is more complex
                            than reading and writing a RIS file, without offering any benefit (?).</div>
                        <div>DedupEndNote was developped with EndNote databases and RIS files. Zotero and Zotero RIS
                            files were
                            only later taken in consideration.
                            In 2025 the results from a query in PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were imported into
                            both
                            an EndNote and a Zotero database, exported as RIS files, and deduplicated with DedupEndNote.
                            The results were identical.
                        </div>

                        <h3 id="not_endnote">2. I don't use EndNote, but ...</h3>
                        <div>Sorry, the program has been mainly developed and tested with EndNote export files in RIS
                            format.
                        </div>
                        <div>However, the code is available on <a
                                href="https://github.com/globbestael/DedupEndNote">GitHub</a>.
                            For other databases the main changes will probably have
                            to be made only in the functions for reading and writing.</div>

                        <h3 id="groups">3. I use groups, comments, ... in EndNote and don't want to lose them</h3>
                        <p>EndNote export files in RIS format do not contain grouping information!</p>
                        <p>If you have groupings, ... in your EndNote database before you started using DedupEndNote:
                            use DedupEndNote in MarkMode, and deduplicate then within EndNote only on the Label field.

                        <p>DedupEndNote will miss some duplicate records, e.g.:</p>

                            <li>Records have different starting pages and not 2 DOIs which are the same</li>
                            <li>The publication years of duplicate records can be more than 1 year apart. The validated
                                subset of BIG_SET (4923 records) has 60 examples of duplicate records with different
                                publication years: differences are 1 year (48), 2 years (8) and 4 years (4).</li>
                            <li>Journals titles are not identified as similar (e.g. "Jbr-btr" and "Journal Belge de

                                revisited") and could wrongly identify duplicates. As a consequence "Incidence and
