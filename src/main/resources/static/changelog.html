                <h2>2025-09-10: 1.1.0:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some changes in the comparisons:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Step 2: If a publication has more than 2 pages, the DOIs are compared
                                before the starting pages are compared</li>
                            <li>Step 3: Only the first 40 authors are compared</li>
                            <li>Step 4: Changes in splitting titles with subtitles.
                                Most common languages at the end of title are removed.
                                If one or both titles are empty, the answer is "YES"
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Errata and comments are treated in the same way as replies ("step 4: compare titles" is
                        skipped;
                        and in "enrich the deduplicated records" the longest duplicate title is used)</li>
                    <li>Retractions / retracted publications: in the preprocessing all parts of the title
                        referring to the retraction are removed,
                        and in "enrich the deduplicated records" the longest duplicate title is used).
                        There is no special treatment of retraction notices</li>
                    <li>Comparison of export and deduplication of same publications in EndNote and Zotero</li>
                    <li>Upgrade to Spring Boot 3.5.5, Bootstrap 5.3.8</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>2025-08-01: 1.0.2:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Changed 5th comparison: this comparison is skipped if both publications have the same
                        DOI</li>
                    <li>Enrich deduplicated records: missing journal titles added (esp. "clinicaltrials.gov",
                        and "Social Science Research Network" from Embase.com)</li>
                    <li>Upgrade to Java 21, Spring Boot 3.5.4</li>
                </ul>
                *: A next release will try to handle ClinicalTrials.gov records (from ClinicalTrials.gov,
                Cochrane, Embase (OVID en Embase.com)) better

                <h2>Older versions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>2024-01-14: 1.0.1: BUG: Doesn't handle author last name starting with a hyphen</li>
                    <li>2023-09-02: ISBN-10 and ISBN-13 are compared correctly: 9024274214 = 9789024274215</li>
                    <li>2023-09-02: BUG: Publication years of form "1-1-1989" (instead of "1989") are parsed as years
                    </li>
                    <li>2023-08-21: If a title with ": " has at least 50 characters before the ": ", that first part is
                        also used as a title variant</li>
                    <li>2023-08-21: BUG: Result file for deduplication of two files in Mark mode was not always written
                    </li>
                    <li>2023-08-18: "How to cite" added (CITATION.cff)</li>
                    <li>2023-08-12: Files without IDs (record numbers) for each record (e.g. Zotero), get an ID assigned
                        by DedupEndNote</li>
                    <li>2023-08-12: Deduplication of Conference proceedings from Web of Science was very poor (too many
                        false positives). This problem has been solved</li>
